# Mobile Architect and Programming

### 1) Requirements and Goals

Summary:

The Inventory App was developed to help warehouse managers and staff efficiently manage and track inventory items. The app includes features for user login and registration, viewing and managing inventory in a grid format, updating inventory quantities, and sending SMS notifications for low stock alerts.

User Needs Addressed:

    Efficient Inventory Management: Users need a straightforward way to track, update, and manage their inventory items.
    User Authentication: Secure login and registration to ensure data protection.
    Real-time Updates: Immediate updates to inventory quantities to maintain accurate records.
    Low Stock Alerts: Notifications when inventory levels drop to zero, preventing stockouts.

### 2) Screens and Features

Necessary Screens and Features:

    Login and Registration Screen: Allows users to log in or create new accounts.
    Inventory Grid Screen: Displays all inventory items in a grid format.
    Add/Edit Item Screen: Enables users to add new items or update existing ones.
    Notification System: Sends SMS alerts for low inventory.

User-Centered UI Design:

    Ease of Use: Simple, intuitive navigation to ensure users can quickly find and use key features.
    Consistency: Uniform design elements and interactions across the app.
    Accessibility: Consideration for accessibility features to accommodate all users.

Successful Design Elements:

    Intuitive Navigation: Users can easily move between screens and perform actions with minimal effort.
    Clear Visual Hierarchy: Important information is easily visible and accessible.
    Feedback Mechanisms: Users receive immediate feedback on their actions (e.g., successful item addition, low stock alerts).

### 3) Coding Approach

Techniques and Strategies:

    Modular Coding: Break down the app into manageable components (e.g., separate activities for login, inventory management).
    Iterative Development: Start with basic functionality and gradually add features, testing each iteration.
    In-line Comments: Maintain readability and ease of maintenance by commenting code effectively.

Future Application:

    Modular and Iterative Approach: Continue to use these methods for future projects to ensure manageable development and continuous improvement.
    Comprehensive Documentation: Enhance in-line comments and external documentation for better code maintenance.

### 4) Testing Process

Testing Techniques:

    Unit Testing: Test individual components for correctness.
    Integration Testing: Ensure that different parts of the app work together seamlessly.
    User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Gather feedback from real users to validate functionality and usability.

Importance and Revelations:

    Error Detection: Identified and resolved bugs early in the development process.
    User Experience: Revealed areas for improvement in UI design and functionality.
    Reliability: Ensured that the app performs reliably under various conditions.

### 5) Overcoming Challenges

Innovation and Problem Solving:

    Database Management: Implementing efficient database queries and operations to handle real-time updates.
    User Authentication: Ensuring secure and smooth login and registration processes.
    SMS Permissions: Handling user permissions for SMS notifications gracefully, ensuring the app continues to function even if permissions are denied.

### 6) Demonstration of Knowledge, Skills, and Experience

Successful Component:

    User Authentication and Security: Demonstrated strong understanding of secure coding practices by implementing robust login and registration processes.
    Database Integration: Successfully designed and managed the SQLite database, ensuring efficient data handling and persistence.
    User-Centered Design: Effectively created a user-friendly UI that catered to the needs of the target users, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.
